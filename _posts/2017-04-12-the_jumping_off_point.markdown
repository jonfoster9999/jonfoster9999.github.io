I have been enjoying my time learning to code here at Flatiron more than any learning experience I've ever had! Prior to coming I had been self teaching with dribs and drabs of what I could find on the internet, as well with various memberships to some of the coding sites. I was quenching my thirst for learning to code but my overall journey felt disconnected. I craved the focus of a program which would give me the things I needed to know, for the specific goal of becoming desirable to employers. I also felt as if I was floating around in that department also, how would I know what to present (and how to present it) to potential employers? How would I even find potential employers?

For some reason, I was compelled to send an instant message one night to a guy I had barely talked to since high school. This guy went to Dartmouth and had been working in computer programming ever since. I took a shot in the dark and asked him for some advice with my concerns in my quest for becomming a programmer. After a little small talk he mentioned Flatiron (specifically) as a place that he had seen a lot of successful programmers coming out of. The company he works for had even just hired some. I did some research and within a week I was signed up.

I enrolled in the Full Stack Web Development program with the counseling/job placement aspect being the most appealing aspect to me. The curriculum has been top notch and I've learned more here than I've ever learned anywhere. I'm proud to say I just submitted my final project after 3 and a half very determined months. I've just connected with my career coach and am extremely excited to keep moving forward! I still have a lot of questions but they are becoming clearer. Sometimes when learning to code you feel like you are in a vaccuum, you can work on a lab or a problem solving one specific issue, without realizing how that connects to the context of how that will apply to a real life situation. I'm still looking forward to finding all of that out. I'm going forward with a very optimistic open mind and can't wait to see what lies in my future!
