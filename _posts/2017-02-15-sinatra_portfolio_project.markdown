I loved working on this project. There were many "a-ha" moments for me in this phase of the curriculum. Up until now most of the programming I've been in a vacuum, writing methods that perform certain tasks that could out output to a terminal. As much fun as I've been having, (and I have been having a ton of fun), I was doing a lot of wondering about out how these techniques and methods would finally translate to real world applications. I first began to see during the object oriented ruby section how you could build applications around objects that mirrored real world instances of things. That really blew my mind. Now, through the Sinatra portfolio section I'm seeing how CRUD works and it's really starting to connect more dots. As I understand it, this is setting me up for Rails and I feel I'm really gaining some insight as to how all of these things work. It's very exciting. 

For the topic of my Sinatra portfolio project I picked something I'm enthusiastic about, my retro video game console and games collection. I built a site which allows a user to log in, create consoles and games which they can add and remove from their collections. I build CRUD operations for both games and consoles, and used a lot of the techniques I learned in the lessons approaching the project. I used restful URLS and users can only edit their own collection. I utilized several relationships, many-to-many with join table, has many, and belongs to. 

Other techniques I applied that I learned from the lessons were to give the users secure passwords via Bcrypt, and to use a layout template which yields to the rest of the ERB files. I had some issues resolving file paths for the public directory and was able to solve them with researching and Stack Overflow. 

This was the most fun project yet! I love Ruby and I love Flatiron!
