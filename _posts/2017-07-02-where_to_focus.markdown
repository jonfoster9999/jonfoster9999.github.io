I've been spending a lot of time lately thinking about how I can make myself into the best and most valuable programmer I can be. As a junior developer in a large field of talented engineers,  I have to figure out a way to stand out and make my mark. I've come to believe that showing an impressive body of work to a potential employer is one of the most important things one can do as a developer trying to make their way.

Stepping back from aggressively job searching a tad and focusing on continuing to learn is a bit difficult. I am very excited to enter the work force and start coding daily. Most days I feel that I've learned enough to make myself employable, but I still see many job descriptions where I don't even recognize 3, 4, or 5 frameworks they mention (let alone have the ability to code in them). I've realized that to compete in today's market I've got to be well versed. I've made it a priority to dedicate some of the time I'd otherwise be focusing on a job search to continuing to learn via online resources like blogs and tutorials. I have been what I've learned to build a portfolio, and the advantages are twofold. I am learning techniques that I will be able to apply to any job I land, and I also am accumulating a larger body of work to show my style of programming. I feel like this is a very productive time in my coding journey, and am excited to continue to learn and build.
