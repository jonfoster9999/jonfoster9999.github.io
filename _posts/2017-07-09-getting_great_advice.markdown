As a new eager developer looking for his first position, I've had a lot of questions about where to focus my activity. It can be daunting to read job descriptions that mention many frameworks you've never heard of. The world of programming seems to have an air almost like show business, where you need to "break in." Many companies seem to not be interested in hiring "freshers" and this is understandable. In such a competitive world they want an applicant that can hit the ground running, rather than one that still needs to be taught some fundamentals. 

This can be frustrating but I can also see why it needs to be this way. The rewards of being a programmer are great, and if it was easy, everyone would do it. Flatiron has a great job search track and a big part of that is cold outreach to developers that work at companies that you would like to work at.

While I have not yet found my position, I have had a lot of great interaction with seasoned programmers from engaging in this approach. Each conversation I have with a developer that's already in a position I'd like to be in brings me one step closer to being prepared to be there. I am always amazed and grateful when a busy programmer takes time out of their schedules to reply with great advice when they have nothing to gain from it. 

The most recent peice of advice that really struck me was regarding what I should be concentrated on learning right now. I have been struggling with how to make myself a more valuable programmer based on the fact that lack of experience is my biggest hurdle at the moment. I've been pushing myself to learn all sorts of frameworks and languages so that I'd be able to talk about them at interviews. This programmer who replied to me made a lot of sense when he said to be careful about trying to become a master of everything. Everyone knows the old saying "a jack of all trades, and a master of none." Well, the same applies here in programming. There is not much use in spreading myself super thing, learning all sorts of syntax that I probably won't remember anyway. I am best served picking one or two things to get really, really good at. 

It's advice like this that I need to continue to hear to narrow my path to becoming a successful programmer. There are many, many people who have come before me and made their way to great positions, and the best way to get where I want to go is to study those who have done it before me. I am all eyes and ears!
