I have been working with quite a bit of raw SQL lately. I am persuing a role where database architecture is a major factor. I was grateful to have a background in SQL because of my time at Flatiron, but I found that I was pretty rusty at it when I went back to it. 

While learning programming, SQL seemed like a chore, something to get through to get back to writing functions and classes. On first glance I thought of it as simple, with the syntax being very straightforward. However, the SQL module quickly ramped up in difficulty, and I went from thinking it was simple to extremely frustrating! It was fair to say that I didn't like it too much, and was happy when it ended.  Since it had, I hadn't thought of it much and gladly traded it for Rails and ActiveRecord. I was a bit taken aback when I was asked to work in raw SQL for a case study, pertaining to a role I was persuing. 

I had a large list of information presented to me and I had to organize the schema and data architecture. I was slow to get started as my SQL nightmares came flooding back! I couldn't believe how quickly I could get stuck on what seemed like a simple problem while writing queries.

However, I pushed forward and began watching tutorials (my favorite way to learn) on the matter. As I got reaquainted with syntax and concepts I actually began to have fun. Writing effective SQL is challenging, but it's very rewarding when you finally get what you're going for! I have a new respect and affinity for it as I plow ahead.
