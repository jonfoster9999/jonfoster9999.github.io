Since graduation, I've been doing a lot of jumping around in my learning. I see a lot of technologies out there that interest me, and I'll usually pick something and just start watching tutorials on it. It's been a lot of fun, but I've noticed something about this. When I go back to a familiar language or enviroment, I feel frustrated because some basic syntax that I thought I had completely committed to memory will elude me. 

This happened just a couple of days ago, when I was tasked with writing SQL queries for a job case study. I spent at least a couple weeks nailing SQL syntax into my head when I was in Flatiron, but when I went to write some queries, I felt like I was in no man's land. It's no wonder, since I last looked at SQL, I had done Flatiron Modules in JavaScript, Rails, Angular etc. And since then, I've dived into things like Angular 4 and Node. It had been quite awhile since I even looked at SQL. Still, I felt frustrated because I wondered where all the knowledge I had crammed into my head then had went. 

So at first I felt like I was a beginner starting from scratch. But then I noticed something different from other times I had experienced this feeling. Although I wasn't totally keen on exact syntax, I had remembered *what* certain commands were supposed to do, the *concepts* behind them. To me this was a big moment because, although I may experience this from time to time as I jump around between languages, I know that all the while, my handle of concepts are growing. I can find my way around if I at least know my context, and that's a lot different than starting from scratch.
