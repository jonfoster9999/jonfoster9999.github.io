Going through the Flatiron online curriculum was a great experience. Besides learning technical aspects of code, I also learned a lot of self discipline and organization. This was necessary in the "go at your own pace" setup.

Continuing my learning post-graduation has been a little bit of an adjustment, but thankfully I have retained some of the increased work ethic I developed while going through the Learn curriculum. Flatiron was very structured and I always knew just what to do next. The labs went in order, you weren't supposed to skip around, and every module had a conclusion/goal/final project. Now I am out on my own to explore technologies and increase my value as a programmer.

While this is an exciting task, it's also a daunting one. Sometimes I look at a job description and see three or four languages I've never even touched. This feeling is overwhelming, and it makes me want to read about/learn all of them at once. However I also realize that if I were to spread myself so thin, I'd probably learn less than if I focused on just one. I try to remind myself that this is a journey, and that no programmer learns all of this stuff overnight. I will be spreading out this knowledge over years and years of my career. 

Still, I find myself having 4-5 things going at once. I'm taking an Angular 4 course on Udemy, reading POODR by Sandi Metz, doing code challenges on CoderByte, watching design tutorials on youtube. I bounce between these sometimes in an ADHD fashion. I will see someone write a bit of code in JavaScript, and my mind will say "I know how to write that same code in Ruby...but wait...I've forgotten the syntax." The next thing you know, the video is paused and I am in a repl, trying to write the forgotten code. 

I have to wonder how effective this is, and I'm still trying to figure out the best work flow. However I do know that if I'm spending my time learning, no matter the method, it's better than no learning at all. Thankfully, as I stated before I've gained a lot of work ethic from my time going through the curriculum. If I haven't spent a good portion of time learning in a given day, when I lay down that night I feel like I've missed something. I heard someone say this week, "you can only do two things with time, spend it or waste it." I've found something I love, and will continue to spend my time every day learning about it. So many languages, so little time!
