I joined Flatiron right on the cusp of Angular 1 being phased out as the final module in favor of React (this is understandable, in the technology field we seem to live on perpetual cusp). I really enjoyed the concepts I learned in Angular, but after having finished the module I thought I should take heed that Flatiron must have switched these modules for a reason, and after some reading I did find that Angular 1 was sort of a dying art form (though many companies are still on it).

The module was still very useful however, because I was able to learn the concept of MVC in the front end. That's one of the great things about programming. Many frameworks seem to be fleeting and "flavor of the month"-ish, but once you grasp key concepts and big picture ideas, implementing them is just a matter of learning the syntax. 

I spoke to a friend who told me that React was very similar to Angular in many regards, including that 'MVC in the front end' functionality. I thought it would be fun to go ahead and start up with React. 

While doing some research about React I started learning about what was happening with Angular in the meantime. Many of the posts I was reading were people discussing learning the new Angular or React. The reactions were split and there were good arguments on both sides. One such article's opinion was that React was the most marketable right now, but Angular 4 might be the future.

Having already learned a lot about Angular 1 I decided I would look into learning the new Angular version. As it turns out Angular 2 was a compete rewrite of Angular 1.  Angular 4 came right after Angular 2 (3 was skipped to avoid confusion with a previous update in the angular router). This version is very similar to 2, not a complete rewrite, like 1 to 2. However, much of what I learned in Angular 1 would not carry over to the new versions.

I really liked what I knew of Angular though, and I liked the idea that the new version is sort of up and coming. I decided to buy an online course for it and have really been loving it. Angular now uses TypeScript, which is sort of like an extension of JavaScript (all valid JavaScript code is valid TypeScript code, but not necessarily the other way around). The TypeScript is compiled into JavaScript to be run in the browser. Writing in TypeScript is fun, you can be explicit about variable types and you are given notifications by the IDE before runtime about errors.  Also, it is largely class based. Components of the dom written in TypeScript are actually instances of a class. This leads to all sorts of control. Data can be stored in services and injected into the program at different points, depending on whether you want new instances of the data or if you want to share the same data throughout the components. 

I'm having a great time with Angular 4 and plan on continuing to learn the entire MEAN stack. I already have another course lined up for this after I finish this deep dive into Angular. I'm very excited to keep on learning!
