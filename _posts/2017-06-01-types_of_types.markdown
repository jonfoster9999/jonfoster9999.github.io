As I dive further into the world of programming, I've been reading a lot about "types" and all the different opinions people have of them. My first exposure to programming was with JavaScript and as such, dynamic typing feels the most natural to me. Shortly thereafter, I took a class in Java and was introduced to static types. This felt stuffy and clunky to me at first, but I slowly saw some benefits. As I do more research, it seems that there exists a parity between the two schools of thought, sort of a "Coke vs Pepsi", and seems to have a lot with how you were 'brought up' in programming, so to speak. I am currently reading POODR by Sandi Metz. She breaks down the tradeoffs quite eloquently.

She makes a strong case for dynamic typing, even devoting an entire section to converting die hard static typers. I have to say that I agree with her, in my limited experience. With dynamic typing you are much more free to send the same messages to different types of objects (Duck Typing) and can more easily write metaprogramming. These are extremely attractive features to me. I do understand the static type afficianado's point of view though. While learning Ruby, I remember being a little bummed when some features where being abstracted away and core programming that I was learning was no longer required. While writing very low level specific code I felt that I was more in control and that my job as an engineer was more technical. When the "magic" of Rails was introduced, I remember feeling a little sad that the very techinical things I was learning where not necessarily required, that I could trust a framework to work for me. Of course I come to find out that these frameworks don't even necessarily make your job "easy", that they are a whole other set of skills to learn. 

When it all comes down to it, it seems to be a matter of preference, again, a "Coke vs Pepsi" or a "Ford vs Chevy" situation.  Youtube videos I watch have enthusiasts on both sides poking fun at the other, and I think it is a healthy environment for growth and competitiveness. I am very excited to continue to learn from both schools of thought.
