I've been reflecting lately on what hooked me about coding. From the very beginning it grabbed me, and now looking back at when I first began, I remember how I always liked puzzles. Coding to me is just one huge massive puzzle that I want to just keep poking at and trying to put together. The beauty of it is that it's a life long journey, for every inch I gain in the puzzle, there is more being created on the other side.

I was a bit intimidated to start because I thought that to be in programming, you had to have an eye for design. I've always been a creative person and mechanically minded, but never had much of a propensity towards visual art. It turns out from my research that one can make a very good living just dealing with the nuts and bolts of the backend, and this is where most of my passion lies.

However, I'm finding that the more developing I'm doing, the less fear I'm having tweaking designs and am actually starting to enjoy it. I think that while there are certainly people that are naturally gifted towards art and design, there is a fair amount of it that can be learned by trial and error and by comparing your work to what looks good on the web. I'm feeling less intimidated to make visual presentations and have begun to find it a whole new way of being able to express creativity. 

I love programming because you are using almost every muscle of the mind. You have to have the groundwork correct, in a very technical fashion. The i's must be dotted and t's crossed for everything to work properly. Syntax-wise, everything must be 'just so' or the appication will completely fail.

However, in parallel, you have this full license to be as creative as you want to be, both visually/artistically and in code style. I cannot think of any other activity which so well embodies both sides of the mind, and that is why I think I love it so much.
