As I continue to work on the Flatiron career track in search of my big break into software development, I've noticed a need to stand out as a job applicant. The pool of new software developers is huge, and while there are jobs for everyone eventually, it's easy to get lost in the mix. 

As a result I understand the importance of constant continued learning. My focus now is on ways to make myself more valuable as a software developer. The knowledge I accumulated from the Flatiron curriculum was immense, and it's a tempting thing to rest on those laurels for a little bit. However I know that to compete in the industry I must be pushing myself every day. 

I have not skipped a beat since the end of the curriculum and have been taking online courses and tutorials every day. I know that it's this hard work that will eventually make me stand out from the competition. What's great is that creating this work ethic for yourself becomes addictive, and you don't feel right if you miss a day. 

I've noticed a difference in how I approach code as I get more comfortable. A friend of mine told me once that when they had a newborn child, they felt that they had to hold them ever so delicately for fear of injuring them. But as time went on they jokingly said that they were so maluable that they could kind of put them up on the table and change their diaper 1-2-3, wham bam boom! This reminds me of working with code. Early on I would sort of delicately poke and prod at a problem, feeling like the code was delicate and I could shatter it with a wrong keystroke. Now I'm not afraid to try completely crazy things and see if they work. There is less fear. The worst that can happen is an error message.

I definitely feel like I'm growing and that I'm hitting new strides on my journey. I look forward to applying the skills I'm learning every day!
